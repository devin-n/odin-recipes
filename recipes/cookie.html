<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These pecan pie cookies look and taste just like mini pecan pies! Perfect for festive cookie parties where you want to make something slightly different.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Butter: This recipe calls for two sticks of butter — ¼ cup for the filling and ¾ cup for the cookies.</li>
    <li>Sugar: You'll need confectioners' sugar for the filling and brown sugar for the cookies.</li>
    <li>Corn syrup: Light corn syrup adds sweetness and helps hold the filling together.</li>
    <li>Pecans: Of course, you'll need finely chopped pecans for these seasonal cookies!</li>
    <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.</li>
    <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
    <li>Egg: One whole egg lends moisture and helps bind the cookie dough,</li>
    <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor.</li>
</ul>
